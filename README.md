# Sonic Text Code Generator - Mk. II
A simple web-based tool to generate zone title cards in Sonic 1 and more (eventually). This is a complete rewrite of a poorly-aged tool I've coded all the way back in 2009.

## Web version
The tool is permanently accessible directly from the web over here:

## Offline version
The tool has been deliberately coded using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS so that it can be downloaded and used offline with any modern browser.
