# Sonic Text Code Generator - Mk. II
A simple web-based tool to generate sprite mappings for zone title cards, credits, and more in Sonic 1 and Sonic 2. This is a complete rewrite of two poorly-aged tools I've coded all the way back in 2009 and 2010.

## Web version
The app is permanently accessible directly from the web over here:

## Offline version
This project has been deliberately coded using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS, so that it can be downloaded and used offline with any modern browser. Just download the `src` folder!

## Fonts
A few third-party fonts were used to spice up the design of this app. Here are all sources:
