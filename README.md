# Sonic Text Code Generator - Mk. II
A simple web-based tool to generate zone title cards, credits, and more for Sonic 1 and Sonic 2. This is a complete rewrite of two tpoorly-aged tool I've coded all the way back in 2009 and 2010.

## Web version
The tool is permanently accessible directly from the web over here:

## Offline version
The tool has been deliberately coded using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS so that it can be downloaded and used offline with any modern browser. Just download the `src` folder.

## Fonts
A few third-party fonts were used to spice up the design of this app. Here are all sources:

* Sonic 1 Title Cards: https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2709973/sonic-1-title-card-fixed
* Sonic 1 Credits: https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2378084/broadway-pixel-c
* Sonic 2 Title Cards: https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1828880/sonic-2-6
